all of which are currently categorized as Breeds.\",  Genetic materials that are typically cryogenically preserved include sperm, oocytes, embryos and somatic cells.,  Cryogenic facilities are called gene banks and can vary greatly in size usually according to the economic resources available.,  They must be able to facilitate germplasm collection, processing, freezing, and long term storage, all in a hygienic and organized manner.,  Gene banks must maintain a precise database and make information and genetic resources accessible to properly facilitate cryoconservation.,  Cryoconservation is an \"ex situ\" conservation strategy that often coexists alongside \"in situ\" conservation to protect and preserve livestock genetics.,  Cryoconservation of livestock genetic resources is primarily done in order to preserve the genetics of populations of interest, such as indigenous breeds, also known as local or minor breeds.,  Material may be stored because individuals shared specific genes and phenotypes that may be of value or have potential value for researchers or breeders.,  Therefore, one of the main goals remains preserving the gene pool of local breeds that may be threatened.,  Indigenous livestock genetics are commonly threatened by factors such as globalization, modernization, changes in production systems, inappropriate introduction of major breeds, genetic drift, inbreeding, crossbreeding, climate change, natural disasters, disease, cultural changes, and urbanization.,  Indigenous livestock are critical to sustainable agricultural development and food security, due to their: adaptation to environment and endemic diseases, indispensable part in local production systems, social and cultural significance, and importance to local rural economies.,  The genetic resources of minor breeds have value to the local farmers, consumers of the products, private companies and investors interested in crossbreeding, breed associations, governments, those conducting research and development, and non-governmental organizations.,  Therefore, efforts have been made by national governments and non-governmental organizations, such as the Livestock Conservancy, to encourage conservation of livestock genetics through cryoconservation, as well as through other \"ex situ\" and \"in situ\" strategies.,  Cryogenic specimens of livestock genetic resources can be preserved and used for extended periods of time.,  This advantage makes cryoconservation beneficial particularly for threatened breeds who have low breed populations.,  Cryogenically preserved specimens can be used to revive breeds that are endangered or extinct, for breed improvement, crossbreeding, research and development.,  However, cryoconservation can be an expensive strategy and requires long term hygienic and economic commitment for germplasms to remain viable.,  Cryoconservation can also face unique challenges based on the species, as some species have a reduced survival rate of frozen germplasm.]], [Bosnian Coarse-haired Hound, [The Bosnian Coarse-haired Hound or Bosanski Oštrodlaki Gonič, also called the Barak, is a hunting dog breed developed in Bosnia.,  The breed is a scenthound, originally used to hunt large game.,  The \"Bosanski Oštrodlaki Gonič's\" name is translated as coarse-haired, broken-haired, and rough-haired (among others), and refers to the texture of the shaggy coat (usually called \"broken-haired\" or \"hard\" in English.)]], [Bosnian Mountain Horse, [The Bosnian Mountain Horse (Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian: Bosanski brdski konj / Босански брдски коњ), also known as \"Bosnian Pony\", is the only indigenous breed of domestic horse in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where it constitutes about 70% of the horse population.,  It is a small horse and is used both as a pack animal and for riding.,  Breed numbers were severely reduced during the Bosnian War of 1992–1995, and, unlike populations of other farm animals, continued to fall after the end of the war.]], [Nahal Barak, [Nahal Barak (Hebrew: נחל ברק‎ ‎ ), also known as Barak gorge or Barak river, is a dry stream bed and canyon in the Arava desert in Israel's South District.,  When it is flooded, Nahal Barak forms part of the network of streams that drain the Negev desert.,  The stream itself is 18 km long, and flows into Nahal HaArava, which in turn flows into Nahal Paran.,  The stream cuts through limestone to form the gorge, which is known as White Canyon, and is available for hiking.]], [Dunker, [A Dunker, also known as the Norwegian Hound, is a medium-sized breed of dog from Norway.,  It was bred by Wilhelm Dunker to be a scenthound by crossing a Russian Harlequin Hound with dependable Norwegian scent hounds.]]]</td>\n",

with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.,  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.,  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.,  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.,  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.,  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.,  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.,  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.,  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.,  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.,  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.,  Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.,  Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification.]], [Case Gym, [Case Gym is a 1,800-seat multi-purpose arena at Boston University in Boston, Massachusetts.,  It opened in 1972 as part of

field.,  It has initiated programs that have saved multiple breeds from extinction, and works closely with similar organizations in other countries, including Rare Breeds Canada.,  With 3,000 members, a staff of nine and a 19-member board of directors, the organization has an operating budget of almost half a million dollars.]], [Istrian Shorthaired Hound, [The Istrian Short-haired Hound (FCI No. 151, original name is \"Istarski Kratkodlaki Gonič\") is a breed of dog from Istria in Croatia, descended from a very old type of scenthound.,  This hound is the slightly smaller counterpart to the longer-coated Istrian Coarse-haired Hound from the same region.]], [Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources, [Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources is a strategy wherein samples of animal genetic materials are preserved cryogenically.,  Animal genetic resources, as defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, are \"those animal species that are used, or may be used, for the production of food and agriculture, and the populations within each of them.,  These populations within each species can be classified as wild and feral populations, landraces and primary populations, standardised breeds, selected lines, varieties, strains and any conserved genetic material; all of which are currently categorized as Breeds.\",  Genetic materials that are typically cryogenically preserved include sperm, oocytes, embryos and somatic cells.,  Cryogenic facilities are called gene banks and can vary greatly in size usually according to the economic resources available.,  They must be able to facilitate germplasm collection, processing, freezing, and long term storage, all in a hygienic and organized manner.,  Gene banks must maintain a precise database and make information and genetic resources accessible to properly facilitate cryoconservation.,  Cryoconservation is an \"ex situ\" conservation strategy that often coexists alongside \"in situ\" conservation to protect and preserve livestock genetics.,  Cryoconservation of livestock genetic resources is primarily done in order to preserve the genetics of populations of interest, such as indigenous breeds, also known as local or minor breeds.,  Material may be stored because individuals shared specific genes and phenotypes that may be of value or have potential value for researchers or breeders.,  Therefore, one of the main goals remains preserving the gene pool of local breeds that may be threatened.,  Indigenous livestock genetics are commonly threatened by factors such as globalization, modernization, changes in production systems, inappropriate introduction of major breeds, genetic drift, inbreeding, crossbreeding, climate change, natural disasters, disease, cultural changes, and urbanization.,  Indigenous livestock are critical to sustainable agricultural development and food security, due to their: adaptation to environment and endemic diseases, indispensable part in local production systems, social and cultural significance, and importance to local rural economies.,  The genetic resources of minor breeds have value to the local farmers, consumers of the products, private companies and investors interested in crossbreeding, breed associations, governments, those conducting research and development, and non-governmental organizations.,  Therefore, efforts have been made by national governments and non-governmental organizations, such as the Livestock Conservancy, to encourage conservation of livestock genetics through cryoconservation, as well as through other \"ex situ\" and \"in situ\" strategies.,  Cryogenic specimens of livestock genetic resources can be preserved and used for extended periods of time.,  This advantage makes cryoconservation beneficial particularly for threatened breeds who have low breed populations.,  Cryogenically preserved specimens can be used to revive breeds that are endangered or extinct, for breed improvement, crossbreeding, research and development.,  However, cryoconservation can be an expensive strategy and requires long term hygienic and economic commitment for germplasms to remain viable.,  Cryoconservation can also face unique challenges based on the species, as some species have a reduced survival rate of frozen germplasm.]], [Bosnian Coarse-haired Hound, [The Bosnian Coarse-haired Hound or Bosanski Oštrodlaki Gonič, also called the Barak, is a hunting dog breed developed in Bosnia.,  The breed is a scenthound, originally used to hunt large game.,  The \"Bosanski Oštrodlaki Gonič's\" name is translated as coarse-haired, broken-haired, and rough-haired (among others), and refers to the texture of the shaggy coat (usually called \"broken-haired\" or \"hard\" in English.)]], [Bosnian Mountain Horse, [The Bosnian Mountain Horse (Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian: Bosanski brdski konj / Босански брдски коњ), also known as \"Bosnian Pony\", is the only indigenous breed of domestic horse in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where it constitutes about 70% of the horse population.,  It is a small horse and is used both as a pack animal and for riding.,  Breed numbers were severely reduced during the Bosnian War of 1992–1995, and, unlike populations of other farm animals, continued to fall after the end of the war.]], [Nahal Barak, [Nahal Barak (Hebrew: נחל ברק‎ ‎ ), also known as Barak gorge or Barak river, is a dry stream bed and canyon in the Arava desert in Israel's South District.,  When it is flooded, Nahal Barak forms part of the network of streams that drain the Negev desert.,  The stream itself is 18 km long, and flows into Nahal HaArava, which in turn flows into Nahal Paran.,  The stream cuts through limestone to form the gorge, which is known as White Canyon, and is available for hiking.]], [Dunker, [A Dunker, also known as the Norwegian Hound, is a medium-sized breed of dog from Norway.,  It was bred by Wilhelm Dunker to be a scenthound by crossing a Russian Harlequin Hound with dependable Norwegian scent hounds.]]]   \n",
