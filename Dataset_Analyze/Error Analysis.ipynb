all of which are currently categorized as Breeds.\",  Genetic materials that are typically cryogenically preserved include sperm, oocytes, embryos and somatic cells.,  Cryogenic facilities are called gene banks and can vary greatly in size usually according to the economic resources available.,  They must be able to facilitate germplasm collection, processing, freezing, and long term storage, all in a hygienic and organized manner.,  Gene banks must maintain a precise database and make information and genetic resources accessible to properly facilitate cryoconservation.,  Cryoconservation is an \"ex situ\" conservation strategy that often coexists alongside \"in situ\" conservation to protect and preserve livestock genetics.,  Cryoconservation of livestock genetic resources is primarily done in order to preserve the genetics of populations of interest, such as indigenous breeds, also known as local or minor breeds.,  Material may be stored because individuals shared specific genes and phenotypes that may be of value or have potential value for researchers or breeders.,  Therefore, one of the main goals remains preserving the gene pool of local breeds that may be threatened.,  Indigenous livestock genetics are commonly threatened by factors such as globalization, modernization, changes in production systems, inappropriate introduction of major breeds, genetic drift, inbreeding, crossbreeding, climate change, natural disasters, disease, cultural changes, and urbanization.,  Indigenous livestock are critical to sustainable agricultural development and food security, due to their: adaptation to environment and endemic diseases, indispensable part in local production systems, social and cultural significance, and importance to local rural economies.,  The genetic resources of minor breeds have value to the local farmers, consumers of the products, private companies and investors interested in crossbreeding, breed associations, governments, those conducting research and development, and non-governmental organizations.,  Therefore, efforts have been made by national governments and non-governmental organizations, such as the Livestock Conservancy, to encourage conservation of livestock genetics through cryoconservation, as well as through other \"ex situ\" and \"in situ\" strategies.,  Cryogenic specimens of livestock genetic resources can be preserved and used for extended periods of time.,  This advantage makes cryoconservation beneficial particularly for threatened breeds who have low breed populations.,  Cryogenically preserved specimens can be used to revive breeds that are endangered or extinct, for breed improvement, crossbreeding, research and development.,  However, cryoconservation can be an expensive strategy and requires long term hygienic and economic commitment for germplasms to remain viable.,  Cryoconservation can also face unique challenges based on the species, as some species have a reduced survival rate of frozen germplasm.]], [Bosnian Coarse-haired Hound, [The Bosnian Coarse-haired Hound or Bosanski Oštrodlaki Gonič, also called the Barak, is a hunting dog breed developed in Bosnia.,  The breed is a scenthound, originally used to hunt large game.,  The \"Bosanski Oštrodlaki Gonič's\" name is translated as coarse-haired, broken-haired, and rough-haired (among others), and refers to the texture of the shaggy coat (usually called \"broken-haired\" or \"hard\" in English.)]], [Bosnian Mountain Horse, [The Bosnian Mountain Horse (Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian: Bosanski brdski konj / Босански брдски коњ), also known as \"Bosnian Pony\", is the only indigenous breed of domestic horse in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where it constitutes about 70% of the horse population.,  It is a small horse and is used both as a pack animal and for riding.,  Breed numbers were severely reduced during the Bosnian War of 1992–1995, and, unlike populations of other farm animals, continued to fall after the end of the war.]], [Nahal Barak, [Nahal Barak (Hebrew: נחל ברק‎ ‎ ), also known as Barak gorge or Barak river, is a dry stream bed and canyon in the Arava desert in Israel's South District.,  When it is flooded, Nahal Barak forms part of the network of streams that drain the Negev desert.,  The stream itself is 18 km long, and flows into Nahal HaArava, which in turn flows into Nahal Paran.,  The stream cuts through limestone to form the gorge, which is known as White Canyon, and is available for hiking.]], [Dunker, [A Dunker, also known as the Norwegian Hound, is a medium-sized breed of dog from Norway.,  It was bred by Wilhelm Dunker to be a scenthound by crossing a Russian Harlequin Hound with dependable Norwegian scent hounds.]]]</td>\n",

impacted the point at which the two rivers meet.]], [Copsi, [Copsi (or Copsig; Old English: \"Cōpsige\" ) [died 1067] was a Northumbrian magnate in late Anglo-Saxon England.,  He was a supporter of

Tostig's defeat at Stamford Bridge, and when William the Conqueror prevailed at Hastings he travelled, in March 1067, to pay William homage at Barking (where William was staying while his tower was being constructed in London).,  In return, William made Copsi earl of Northumbria and sent him back to York.,  Copsi's rule lasted a mere five weeks, at which time he was murdered by Osulf, son of

all of which are currently categorized as Breeds.\",  Genetic materials that are typically cryogenically preserved include sperm, oocytes, embryos and somatic cells.,  Cryogenic facilities are called gene banks and can vary greatly in size usually according to the economic resources available.,  They must be able to facilitate germplasm collection, processing, freezing, and long term storage, all in a hygienic and organized manner.,  Gene banks must maintain a precise database and make information and genetic resources accessible to properly facilitate cryoconservation.,  Cryoconservation is an \"ex situ\" conservation strategy that often coexists alongside \"in situ\" conservation to protect and preserve livestock genetics.,  Cryoconservation of livestock genetic resources is primarily done in order to preserve the genetics of populations of interest, such as indigenous breeds, also known as local or minor breeds.,  Material may be stored because individuals shared specific genes and phenotypes that may be of value or have potential value for researchers or breeders.,  Therefore, one of the main goals remains preserving the gene pool of local breeds that may be threatened.,  Indigenous livestock genetics are commonly threatened by factors such as globalization, modernization, changes in production systems, inappropriate introduction of major breeds, genetic drift, inbreeding, crossbreeding, climate change, natural disasters, disease, cultural changes, and urbanization.,  Indigenous livestock are critical to sustainable agricultural development and food security, due to their: adaptation to environment and endemic diseases, indispensable part in local production systems, social and cultural significance, and importance to local rural economies.,  The genetic resources of minor breeds have value to the local farmers, consumers of the products, private companies and investors interested in crossbreeding, breed associations, governments, those conducting research and development, and non-governmental organizations.,  Therefore, efforts have been made by national governments and non-governmental organizations, such as the Livestock Conservancy, to encourage conservation of livestock genetics through cryoconservation, as well as through other \"ex situ\" and \"in situ\" strategies.,  Cryogenic specimens of livestock genetic resources can be preserved and used for extended periods of time.,  This advantage makes cryoconservation beneficial particularly for threatened breeds who have low breed populations.,  Cryogenically preserved specimens can be used to revive breeds that are endangered or extinct, for breed improvement, crossbreeding, research and development.,  However, cryoconservation can be an expensive strategy and requires long term hygienic and economic commitment for germplasms to remain viable.,  Cryoconservation can also face unique challenges based on the species, as some species have a reduced survival rate of frozen germplasm.]], [Bosnian Coarse-haired Hound, [The Bosnian Coarse-haired Hound or Bosanski Oštrodlaki Gonič, also called the Barak, is a hunting dog breed developed in Bosnia.,  The breed is a scenthound, originally used to hunt large game.,  The \"Bosanski Oštrodlaki Gonič's\" name is translated as coarse-haired, broken-haired, and rough-haired (among others), and refers to the texture of the shaggy coat (usually called \"broken-haired\" or \"hard\" in English.)]], [Bosnian Mountain Horse, [The Bosnian Mountain Horse (Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian: Bosanski brdski konj / Босански брдски коњ), also known as \"Bosnian Pony\", is the only indigenous breed of domestic horse in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where it constitutes about 70% of the horse population.,  It is a small horse and is used both as a pack animal and for riding.,  Breed numbers were severely reduced during the Bosnian War of 1992–1995, and, unlike populations of other farm animals, continued to fall after the end of the war.]], [Nahal Barak, [Nahal Barak (Hebrew: נחל ברק‎ ‎ ), also known as Barak gorge or Barak river, is a dry stream bed and canyon in the Arava desert in Israel's South District.,  When it is flooded, Nahal Barak forms part of the network of streams that drain the Negev desert.,  The stream itself is 18 km long, and flows into Nahal HaArava, which in turn flows into Nahal Paran.,  The stream cuts through limestone to form the gorge, which is known as White Canyon, and is available for hiking.]], [Dunker, [A Dunker, also known as the Norwegian Hound, is a medium-sized breed of dog from Norway.,  It was bred by Wilhelm Dunker to be a scenthound by crossing a Russian Harlequin Hound with dependable Norwegian scent hounds.]]]   \n",
